I want my GitHub profile not to look empty, hence the [script](./dump-annual-commits.sh) that creates multiple commits for the 12 months following a given date.

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- MacOS `date` command

## Usage

Provide a starting date and it will create multiple commits for the 12 months following that date.

```bash
./dump-annual-commits.sh 2023-01-01
```

## This is stupid

Yeah I know but you could extend it to create pixel art in your GitHub profile.

## Disclaimer

I'm not responsible for any damage caused by this script. Use it at your own risk.
